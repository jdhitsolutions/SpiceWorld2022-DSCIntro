![spiceworld 2022](images/spiceworld2022.png)

The items in this repository include my presentation and demonstration materials for my session on getting started with Desired State Configuration (DSC). The session was part of [Spiceworld 2022](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/).

## Abstract

*Are you spending a lot of time building and deploying server infrastructure? How can you ensure the server is still configured to company standards? This is where Windows PowerShell and Desired State Configuration (DSC) will reduce the pain of server configuration management. DSC is a configuration management framework you can use today. You can use this framework to build a customized management and deployment solution. Long-time PowerShell author and teacher Jeff Hicks will guide you and demonstrate how using DSC improves your efficiency and security.*
